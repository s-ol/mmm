Based on this, a modern data storage and processing ecosystem should enable transclusion of both content and behaviours
between contexts.
Content should be able to be transcluded and referenced to facilitate the creation of flexible data formats and interactions,
such that e.g. a slideshow slide can include content in a variety other formats (such as images and text) from anywhere else in the system.
Behaviours should be able to be transcluded and reused to facilitate the creation of ad-hoc sytems and applets based on user needs.
For example a user-created todo list should be able to take advantage of a sketching tool the user already has access to.

The system should enable the quick creation of ad-hoc software.

While there are drawbacks to cloud-storage of data (as outlined above), the utility of distributed systems is acknowledged,
and the system should therefore be able to include content and behaviours via the network.
This ability should be integrated deeply into the system, so that data can be treated independently of its origin and storage conditions,
with as little caveats as possible.

The system needs to be browsable and understandable by users.
