In the beginning of this thesis multiple downsides of the most widely used end-user computing systems have been
demonstrated and attributed to an over-reliance on a set of design paradigms that do not align well with the goal of
empowering users. On the other hand, it has been shown that many well-recognized historic systems were designed with
this goal in mind.

Based on the aspirations and appraoches of these historic systems, a framework for the evaluation of empowering end-user
computing systems was developed alongside one such system itself. While the proposed system has been shown to have many
flaws and limitations of its own, and is not currently viable as a tool for end-users, it serves to demonstrate the
feasiblity of type coercion and the file system as a focus point for new end-user computing systems, and provides a
reference point for further research.
