this Fileder contains some minimal examples showing support for various languages `mmmfs` supports currently.

Language support is mostly limited by the fact that `mmmfs` currently targets web browsers,
on the server any scripting language that can be executed can theoretically be integrated with minimal effort.

Using the inspector mode to view the source of the Fileders below is encouraged.
