In the last two days I implemented the remaining features for full editing support in the browser:

- support for adding, removing facets in the inspector \[[`dc08e26`][dc08e26]\]
- support for adding, removing fileders in the inspector \[[`ff9ee8e`][ff9ee8e]\]
- implemented the API for reordering fileders as mentioned in [`2019-10-26`][2019-10-26] \[[`053e607`][053e607]\]
- support for reordering fileders in the inspector \[[`16232a2`][16232a2]\]

Here is a short demo video of these features:
