parallax-panels
===============

I'm prototyping an aesthetic for (eurorack) panels that relies on multiple layers of parallax visuals for dramatic effect.

<mmm-embed path="picture" nolink></mmm-embed>

parallax-viewer
===============

I built a little SVG viewer that stacks the layers and lets you view them in parallax.
You can find it <mmm-link path="viewer">here</mmm-link>.

And here's a little demonstration:

<mmm-embed path="viewer/demo" nolink></mmm-embed>
