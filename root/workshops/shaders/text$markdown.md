# (procedural) graphics with math and shaders
This is a workshop i am currently preparing.
If you are interested in having this workshop be held at your institution,
please contact me!

## topics
In this workshop I will cover the principles and tricks behind procedural
graphics and animations like the following examples:

<mmm-embed nolink path="../../projects/demoloops/toroid"></mmm-embed>
<mmm-embed nolink path="../../projects/VJmidiKit/boxy_dnb"></mmm-embed>
<mmm-embed nolink path="../../projects/VJmidiKit/kaleidoscope"></mmm-embed>
<mmm-embed nolink path="../../projects/demoloops/twisted"></mmm-embed>

I plan to introduce the participants to the following topics:

- what are procedural graphics?
- what are shaders?
- drawing a circle (with math)
- transforming space
  - moving, scaling, rotating
  - mirroring, repeating, fractals
  - bending space
- procedural animation
  - tweaking motion
  - easing functions
- signed distance fields and raymarching
- basic lighting

The exact topics and structure can be adjusted based on the course runtime and
level of the participants' experience.
