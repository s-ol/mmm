# creative coding for web developers
This is a workshop i am currently preparing.
If you are interested in having this workshop be held at your institution,
please contact me!

## topics
In this workshop I will introduce the topic of *creative coding*, present some
inspiration and examples, as well as teach the basics of the JavaScript canvas
API for creating artistic animations and other creative projects such as
the following:

<mmm-embed nolink path="../../projects/demoloops/toroid"></mmm-embed>
<mmm-embed nolink path="../../projects/demoloops/twisted"></mmm-embed>

* <mmm-link path="../../experiments/center_of_mass">experiment: aligning fonts by their center of mass</mmm-link>
* <mmm-link path="../../experiments/parallax_panels">experiment: parallax SVG viewer</mmm-link>

The workshop is designed to accompany an 'industry-focused' course in web development,
and aims to deliver some wider perspective over the possibilities and creative use of
technology to participants. The following topics are covered:

- what is creative coding?
- creative coding frameworks
- the canvas API
  - drawing basic shapes
  - colors
  - input events
- animation
  - `requestAnimationFrame`
  - easing functions
- online creative coding communities

The exact topics and structure can be adjusted based on the course runtime and
level of the participants' experience.
