# 8&emsp;conclusion

The historical analysis and the evaluation of the proposed system show that many of the limitations of current
mainstream operating systems can be worked around effectively. The flaws can also be attributed in part to some
concrete design paradigms, which future system designers may seek to avoid. To this end, the framework provided for
evaluation may also be useful.

The system proposed and developed in the project corresponding to this thesis has been shown to successfully implement
many of the properties were hoped to be achieved, such as a modular and consistent architecture and strong support for
mixed-content transclusions. On the other hand, some limitations in the design are apparent. Many of these limitations
constitute candidate topics for further research, and most can be attributed to trade-offs made in the development process.
