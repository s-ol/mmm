# Yay, a first post! A blank blog!

I am starting to blog now as part of an... experiment of sorts.
I have a lot of time on my hands at the moment and I choose to spend it all boring myself.
I re-discovered [streak.club][streak.club] a few days ago and so I decided to give it a shot and try a few new things.

If you never heard of **streak.club**, you should definetely check it out.
It is a small social network built by [leafo](https://twitter.com/moonscript) where people can get together and participate in *Streaks*.
Once you join a streak, you submit an entry every day or every week (depending on the Streak's settings).
People can then like and comment on your entries and give you feedback for your creations.
If you miss a day, nothing bad happens, but yout streak counter gets reset.

One of the streaks I joined is the [*Blog every week*][blogeweek] streak, which I will submit this first post to when I am done.
I also created my own streak, [*Daily Stencil Art*][stencils]. So, for the next month, I will try to design and/or paint one stencil per day.
The [first stencil](https://streak.club/p/7129/kill-bill-the-bride-stencil-by-s0lll0s) I did for the streak turned out really nice, so I will continue to design some in that art style (gold background with black shadow pieces on top and a small piece in an accent color).

As for the future of this blog, I am not quite sure where this will go.
I think I am going to cover my stencil creation process in a post soon (maybe today, maybe next week, who knows?) and also blog about programming/development of games and other stuff I might write.
Maybe I will also port some of the tutorials I have written so far to markdown and put them here aswell.

I hope that **streak.club** will work as well long-term as it does right now, motivation is still probably my number one enemy and streak.club is an excellent way for me to focus on new things and get away from the computer some more aswell.
